<h2 id="about"> About the App ðŸ’» </h2>

Welcome to Shopping App iOS, a sample shopping app built to study SwiftUI and iOS development. This project utilizes the native iOS development stack and is implemented using Swift and SwiftUI.

Develop by @marialuisacp.

<h3 id="started"> Overview </h3>

Shopping App iOS fetches product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/), providing a list of products, filtering options, and detailed information about each product. It aims to showcase the usage of SwiftUI for building modern and intuitive user interfaces in iOS apps.

<h3 id="features"> Features </h3>

- Fetches product data from the Fake Store API
- Displays a list of products with images, titles, prices, and categories
- Supports filtering products by category
- Provides detailed information about each product, including description, price, and image

The main technologies used in this project are:
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- URLSession
- CoreData
- React Native Module

![Swift UI description](./docs/01_swiftUI.png)

In this project, SwiftUI was employed to design native components and screens for iOS, encompassing all primary interfaces. 

<h3 id="resources"> Other Native Resources </h3>

Alongside visual development, the app interacts with the store through requests to fetch products and product categories, facilitated by URLSession. 

Persistence of shopping cart data is achieved using CoreData, ensuring seamless management and retention of user selections within the application.

<h3 id="wdget"> iOS Widget Exentesion </h3>

Introducing our iOS widget designed in SwiftUIâ€”a sleek promotion banner that seamlessly integrates with your daily routine.

This widget serves as a dynamic gateway to exclusive offers and promotions from our app. With a single tap on the banner, users are swiftly redirected to the app, where they can explore and shop featured deals without delay.

This innovative widget enhances user engagement by delivering timely promotions directly to the home screen, ensuring a seamless and rewarding shopping experience.

<h2 id="module"> React Native Module </h2>

![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/react_native-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

To explore the integration of React Native modules into the app, we developed an RN module that is accessible in [this repository](https://github.com/marialuisacp/shopping-app-module-rn).

The module was integrated using RCTView in Swift, incorporating React Native libraries into the project. Additionally, a Bridge Manager was implemented to facilitate seamless communication between the native and React Native environments.
